## A Q&A service where an AI answers all your questions

### Why are we doing this?
We have seen many "inefficiency" on the internet. Everyday, billions of people search the internet for information. Search engines today only show the websites and web apps which relates to the search topic, but not the information itself at a high rate (this excludes dictionary, calculation and some other "instant search data").

If we had a service where all necessary information was provided without the act of "browsing", it would be far better and efficient. (This is why we believe Q&A sites are used often.)

### How is this even possible?
1. We run the question sentence by the user through a neural network. This will allow the AI to recognize what kind of answer the user wants.
2. We use a new web crawling algorithm to get the information needed to solve a problem
3. With the information gathered, the AI will build a result with the answer and explanation (why).
4. The user may "reload" for a better answer if not good enough. This action will make the AI think differently, and if succeeded, the value of neurons will change significantly according to the action.
